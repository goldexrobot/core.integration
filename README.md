# Goldex Robot: Integration

Integration with Goldex consists of two major parts: backend integration and terminal integration.

[Documentation](https://goldexrobot.github.io/core.integration/).

---

## Backend

### Backend callbacks

Goldex sends [callbacks](/CALLBACK.md) to notify your backend about a new events or to request some information for the vending terminal in real time.

Navigate to Goldex dashbaord to setup callbacks, keys etc.

[Documentation](https://goldexrobot.github.io/core.integration/swagger/#/backend-callbacks)

### Backend API

Goldex exposes an API to provide some extended information like photos, storage access history etc.
Moreover the API allows you to control a vending terminal.

Calls to HTTP API must be properly [signed](/SIGNATURE.md) with per-project private key. You can get the key in Goldex dashboard.

GRPC API is also available.

---

## Terminal

Goldex terminal displays customer UI on the screen. UI is an HTML SPA (single page application) serving locally.

The terminal exposes an API that allows a developer to access the terminal hardware, interact with a business backend, etc.

### Terminal UI

UI files must contain `index.html` and `ui-config.yaml`. Index is an entry point for the UI. Config file contains a settings for the UI (see below).

WebKit engine is used to serve HTML. There are some limitations:

- Utilize all the required resources locally, i.e. JS, CSS, icons, etc., except videos;
- Do not embed huge resources like video;
- Do not display transparent video;
- Database is unavailable, use local storage instead;
- PDF rendering is not supported;
- WebGL is not available;
- Java is not available;

Delivery of the UI is done by uploading packed (zip) UI files to Goldex dashboard.

#### UI config

UI config defines externally allowed domains and should provide emergency contacts to show to a customer:

```yaml
# Multiline text to show to a customer (along with "Please contact support team:") in case of critical terminal failure
emergency_contacts:
  - 'Phone: <some phone number here>'
  - 'Whatever: <whatever>'
# List of allowed domains/ports to perform fetch, XMLHttpRequests, images loading, etc. (localhost[:80] is allowed by default)
host_whitelist:
  - example.com
  - example.com:8080
```

### Terminal API

API is a [JSONRPC 2](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) API over [Websocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) connection (`http://localhost:80/ws`).

The API exposes **methods** to control the terminal from UI and sends **events** to notify UI.

[JSONRPC 2 batch](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#batch) requests are not supported. Moreover, hardware-related methods should be called sequently, error will be returned otherwise.

For developing API emulator is available [here](https://github.com/goldexrobot/core.integration/releases).
